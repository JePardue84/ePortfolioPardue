  <p>As I approach the end of my undergraduate degree in Computer Science with a concentration in software engineering, I am proud to say that I have been able to combine my two passions: aviation and technology. For over 10 years, I have been a certified EMS Helicopter pilot, flying patients to and from hospitals in some of the most challenging conditions.

Through my experiences in aviation, I have developed a deep appreciation for the power of technology and its ability to solve complex problems. I have seen firsthand the difference that advanced technology can make in saving lives and improving outcomes for patients. This has led me to pursue a career in software engineering, where I hope to use my skills and knowledge to make a similar impact in healthcare and other industries.

As I look to the future, I am excited to be starting my Masters degree in artificial intelligence at UT Austin in the fall. With this degree, I hope to gain a deeper understanding of how technology can be used to solve some of the most pressing problems facing society today. From healthcare to climate change, I believe that artificial intelligence has the potential to revolutionize the way we approach these challenges.

Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have learned the importance of hard work, dedication, and perseverance. As a helicopter pilot, I have had to stay calm and focused in the face of high-stress situations, relying on my training and experience to make split-second decisions. In software engineering, I have had to be patient and persistent, working through complex problems and debugging code until a solution is found.

Looking back on my journey so far, I am proud of what I have accomplished and excited for what lies ahead. I believe that my unique combination of experience in aviation and software engineering gives me a valuable perspective and skill set that will serve me well in my future endeavors. I am grateful for the opportunities that I have had and for the support of my family and friends along the way.

As I continue to pursue my passion for technology and aviation, I am confident that I will be able to make a meaningful difference in the world. Whether I am designing life-saving software or flying patients to safety, I know that I am using my skills and knowledge to make a positive impact on the lives of others.
