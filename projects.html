  <p>This page lists and contains information and various featured artifacts that showcase my skills and abilities in the computer science industry. Some of them I have completed and others I continue to research and enhance as I continue my educational journey.  I designed and developed the "List This!" application in CS360 Mobile Architect & Programming course. These skills display technical proficiency, creativity, and innovation. The user interfaces are well-designed and user-friendly, highlighting the importance of user experience in software development. Developing an inventory app requires a high level of problem-solving and project management skills. I was able to demonstrate an understanding of the computer science industry, which is essential in today's job market. The process of enhancing the “List This!” app was challenging yet served its purpose as a learning experience in a myriad of ways. I have transitioned the “List This! Lite” app from a SQLite database to a Firebase platform. This provided me with several benefits, such as understanding real-time data synchronization. Firebase offers real-time data synchronization, which means any changes made to the data are immediately updated on all connected devices. Firebase is a cloud-based platform, which can scale automatically to handle increasing traffic and data storage needs. This can save time and resources on managing infrastructure. My app was enhanced in a way where monitoring tools can track user engagement, app usage, and performance issues, making data-driven decisions to improve the app. More complex features and options were also available through cloud functions as Firebase allows for server-side code without necessarily managing server infrastructure. As I reference the two apps and their differences from the links below, for the “List This! Lite” app, I will discuss the existing functionality, provide a code review, and determine necessary enhancements. The review of the “List This” app will feature a similar process, except with a walk-through of the completed enhancements in addition to a code review. GitHub repository links are available at the bottom of each page to reference the actual project and code. Additional projects I continue to work on are a Flutter augmented reality mobile application I am using as a base to learn and educate myself on Flutter and building AR applications. This application will be cross platform Android and iOS.  I have also included an iOS application and IOT project I completed using ESP32. I programmed the ESP32 to run some lighting and designed and developed a basic iOS application with widgets to operate the lighting run on battery power. The 3D printed details can be viewed on the “3D Prints” tab of my main ePortfolio page.
