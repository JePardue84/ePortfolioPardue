<div class="description-container">
  <p>I chose the "List This" artifact to showcase my educational journey and technical proficiency in computer science across the categories of software design and engineering, algorithms and data structure, and databases. These specific inventory applications demonstrate a range of software and coding skills, including Java class files, specific frameworks, and the ability to develop in Android Studio. These skills display technical proficiency, creativity, and innovation. The user interfaces are well-designed and user-friendly as they highlight the importance of user experience in software development. Developing an inventory app requires a high level of problem-solving and project management skills. By developing the "List This" app, I was able to demonstrate an understanding of the computer science industry, which is essential in today's job market. The artifact is an excellent addition to my e-portfolio, as it spotlights my educational journey and technical expertise. The process of enhancing the “List This!” app was challenging yet served its purpose as a learning experience in a myriad of ways. Transitioning the app from a SQLite database to a Firebase platform provided me with several benefits such as understanding real-time data synchronization. Firebase offers real-time data synchronization, which means any changes made to the data are immediately updated on all connected devices. Firebase is a cloud-based platform, which means it can scale automatically to handle increasing traffic and data storage needs. This can save time and resources on managing infrastructure. In my research of security and authentication I also found that Firebase offers built-in authentication and security features, such as email and password authentication, social media logins, and server-side security rules. This can help secure the app and protect user data. An understanding of analytics and performance was also realized as monitoring tools that can track user engagement, app usage, and performance issues make data-driven decisions to improve the app. More complex features and options were also available through cloud functions as Firebase allows for server-side code without necessarily managing server infrastructure. As you reference the two apps and their differences from the links below, for the “List This! Lite” app I will discuss the existing functionality, provide a code review, and determine necessary enhancements. The review of the “List This” app will feature a similar process except with a walk through of the completed enhancements in addition to a code review. There are GitHub repository links at the bottom of each page to reference the actual project and code.
