<div class="description-container">
  <p>I chose the "List This" artifact to showcase my educational journey and technical proficiency in computer science across the categories of software design and engineering, algorithms and data structure, and databases. The various course outcomes were met in several ways. Employ strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision making in the field of computer science. This course outcome was met through these specific inventory applications and the avenues they take to demonstrate a range of software and coding skills such as Java class files, specific frameworks, and ability to develop in Android Studio. These skills display technical proficiency, creativity, and innovation. The user interfaces are well-designed and user-friendly as they highlight the importance of user experience in software development. Developing an inventory app requires a high level of problem-solving and project management skills.  I was able to demonstrate an understanding of the computer science industry, which is essential in today's job market. The artifact is an excellent addition to my e-portfolio, as it spotlights my educational journey and technical expertise. The process of enhancing the “List This!” app was challenging yet served its purpose as a learning experience in a myriad of ways. Design and evaluate computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices and standards appropriate to its solution, while managing the trade-offs involved in design choices. This course outcome was met by developing and enhancing the "List This" app with its respective particulars. Transitioning the app from a SQLite database to a Firebase platform provided me with several benefits such as understanding real-time data synchronization. Firebase offers real-time data synchronization, which means any changes made to the data are immediately updated on all connected devices. Firebase is a cloud-based platform, which means it can scale automatically to handle increasing traffic and data storage needs. This can save time and resources on managing infrastructure. Develop a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits in software architecture and designs to expose potential vulnerabilities, mitigate design flaws, and ensure privacy and enhanced security of data and resources. This course outcome was met through my research of security and authentication as I implemented Firebase and its built-in authentication and security features, such as email and password authentication, social media logins, and server-side security rules. This can help secure the app and protect user data. Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals. This course outcome was met through an understanding and implementation of analytics and performance. My app was enhanced in a way where monitoring tools can track user engagement, app usage, and performance issues make data-driven decisions to improve the app. More complex features and options were also available through cloud functions as Firebase allows for server-side code without necessarily managing server infrastructure. Design, develop, and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts. This course outcome was met throughout the process and presentation of these two applications. As you reference the two apps and their differences from the links below, for the “List This! Lite” app I will discuss the existing functionality, provide a code review, and determine necessary enhancements. The review of the “List This” app will feature a similar process except with a walk through of the completed enhancements in addition to a code review. There are GitHub repository links at the bottom of each page to reference the actual project and code.
